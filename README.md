ANALYZING BIG DATA & PREDICTING THE FUTURE PRICE OF USED CARS.

NITC Project

RESULT: An accuracy of 0.65 or 65% was achieved. Our prediction model can predict the price of a used car with 65% accuracy. We were able to find the accuracy of our prediction model using the following evaluation measures. We used R squared mean, mean absolute error and mean squared error. From this we were able to calculate the accuracy of the model.
